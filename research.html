              >Distributed Computing is a research direction that focuses on
              developing efficient algorithms and techniques for solving complex
              problems in distributed systems. In distributed computing, tasks
              are divided among multiple computational nodes or processors,
              which work collaboratively to solve a problem. Furthermore, the
              emergence of big data has further fueled the need for distributed
              computing. With the exponential growth of data, traditional
              centralized approaches struggle to process and analyze massive
              datasets efficiently. In the Internet of Things (IoT), distributed
              computing enables real-time processing and decision making on a
              large scale with distributed sensors and actuators. I aim
              to solve large-scale distributed problems that cannot be tackled
              by traditional centralized approaches due to computational
              constraints.

              >Information theory plays a pivotal role in the field of distributed learning, providing foundational principles that
            enable efficient data encoding, transmission, and decoding across distributed networks. By leveraging Information
            Theory, we can optimize communication protocols between nodes in a distributed system, ensuring minimal information loss
            and maximizing learning efficiency. This optimization is crucial in scenarios where bandwidth is limited and data
            privacy is paramount, such as in federated learning models. My objective is to explore and harness the principles of
            information theory to enhance distributed learning frameworks. By doing so, I aim to contribute to the development of
            more efficient, secure, and scalable machine learning models that can operate effectively across decentralized networks,
            thereby advancing the capabilities and applications of distributed learning systems.

                <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are revolutionizing the analysis and interpretation of data in the Internet of Things (IoT)
                ecosystem. By modeling IoT devices and their interactions as a dynamic graph, GNNs enable the extraction of complex
                spatial-temporal relationships and patterns within the network. This capability is critical for tasks such as anomaly
                detection, predictive maintenance, and network optimization in IoT systems, where the relational data between devices
                can be highly informative yet challenging to analyze with traditional machine learning methods. My aim is to leverage
                the power of GNNs to enhance the intelligence and efficiency of IoT applications. Through this approach, I aspire to
                contribute to the development of smarter, more autonomous IoT systems capable of self-optimization and more robust
                against disruptions, thereby advancing the operational efficiency and reliability of IoT networks.
